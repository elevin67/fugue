  * CONSONANCE VS. DISSONANCE
  * consonance: unisons, octaves, 3rds, 5ths, 6ths
  * dissonance: 2nds, 7ths, major 2nd and minor 7th are soft, minor 2nd and major 7th are harsh
  * 4ths and tritones can be either depending on situation
  * may need to create both consonant and dissonant of each type of motion for each species
  * Balancing intervals:
  * 3rd and 6ths (steak)
  * 5ths and octaves (potatoes)
  * dissonance (salt and pepper)
  *
  * TYPES OF MOTION
  * parallel motion: go same direction in a scale
  * contrary motion: go in opposite directions in a scale
  * oblique motion: one voice moves while the other stays constant
  * can produce a parallel, contrary, and oblique line?
  *
  * FIVE SPECIES OF COUNTERPOINT
  * First: a single note against another single note
  * Second: two notes against one
  * Third: four notes against one
  * Fourth: all about suspensions and syncopations?
  * Fifth: florid counterpoint? combination of the first four
  * Make methods for all of these?
  *
  * AVOID
  * parallel and direct 5ths and 8ths?
  *
  * FUTURE WORK
  * create a genetic algorithm that takes composer's work,
  * learns taste for three variables in different situations
